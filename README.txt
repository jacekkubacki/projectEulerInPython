Solving algorithmic problems to learn Python.
See: http://projecteuler.net/problems

My goal is to learn Python, so I will focus more on Python concepts and code readability than on implementing the most optimal algorithms.
If I can get the result within 10 seconds I will consider the algorithm as ‘good enough’.

I'm using Python 3.x to be up to date with the new aspects of the language.

I started this project with IDLE, then I switched to Interactive Editor for Python (IEP) and currently I'm using PyCharm CE with git/GitHub integration.
Tests were initially written using pytest, currently I'm using unittest.
