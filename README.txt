Solving algorithmic problems to learn Python.
See: http://projecteuler.net/problems

My goal is to learn Python, so I will focus more on Python concepts and code readability than on implementing the most optimal algorithms.
If I can get the result within 15 seconds I will consider the algorithm as ‘good enough’.
Having said that I will try to improve the algorithms as well, but I will always prefer to solve yet another problem or learn yet another Python technique.

I started this project with IDLE, then I switched to Interactive Editor for Python (IEP).
Currently I'm using PyCharm CE with git/GitHub integration.
