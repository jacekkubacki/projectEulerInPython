# Solving algorithmic problems to learn Python
See: http://projecteuler.net/problems

My goal is to learn Python, so I will focus more on Python concepts and code readability than on implementing the most optimal algorithms.
If on my laptop I can get the result within 10 seconds I will consider the solution as ‘good enough’, otherwise I will try to find more optimal way of solving the problem.

## Python version
I'm using Python 3.x to be up to date with the new aspects of the language.

## Editor
I started this project with IDLE, then I switched to Interactive Editor for Python (IEP) and currently I'm using PyCharm CE.

## Git
I commit the code using different methods: command-line git, git integration in PyCharm or GitHub Desktop app.

## Tests
Tests for _myUtils.py_ were initially written using pytest, currently I'm using unittest.
It has been suggested to me that it would be nice to use http://travis-ci.org/, so here it is.
